# homer-dashboard-personal-config
This is my personal configuration for Homer Dashboard

It relies on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and [NX211/homer-icons](https://github.com/NX211/homer-icons).

Of course I'm not showing the real IP of my Raspberry Pi, so if you wan't to use this config for your Homer installation, you have to change that parameter with your IP.

Second, you have to clone NX211/homer-icons in *assets/icons* folder using `git clone https://github.com/NX211/homer-icons.git` command.
